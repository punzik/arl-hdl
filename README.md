## Disclamer
This is a fork of the [ARL](https://github.com/kaxap/arl) repository, from which everything except HDL languages has been removed. Unfortunately not all HDL languages are represented in the github search list.

###### *(Another Repository List)*
Well, one of the best ways to learn something new is to watch how it is done by others.

Got a new ~~programming~~ HDL language to learn?

Below is the list of lists of most popular repositories, sorted by number of stars, for each of the most favoured ~~programming~~ HDL languages
(according to [StackOverflow](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017)):
 * [Verilog](README-Verilog.md)
 * [SystemVerilog](README-SystemVerilog.md)
 * [VHDL](README-VHDL.md)
 * [Bluespec](README-Bluespec.md)
 * [Bluespec BH](README-Bluespec-BH.md)

~~The list is being updated every Sunday.~~

### Can't find your HDL language?
Feel free to create an issue.
